Revision history for Perl extension Safe::World.

0.05  16 Dec 2003
      - Added methods reset_output(), unlink_all_worlds().
      - Fixed bug on destroy.
      - New module Safe::World::Scope, for objects that works inside the World without share packages.
      - Added dependece to Safe::Hole/0.08, due Safe::World::Scope.
      - All the Safe::World* packages reviseds to use Safe::World::Scope access.


0.04  09 Dec 2003
      - New test with IO::Socket to test select() inside the compartment.
        (Due old problems in other works with Safe and mod_perl, just to ensure that it's ok in Safe::World).
      - Fixed warnings for constant redefinition on Perl-5.8.x when cleanning the compartment.
      - Added method redirect_stdout() and restore_stdout().
      - Fixed bug for internal call of die(). Now die() doesn't exit from the World, only from it's own eval().
        What enables other eval() calls to the World.
      - Fixed bug with ignored warnings, like syntax error.
      - Added method eval_args() and eval_pack_args().


0.03  30 Nov 2003
      - No more dependence of Safe. Own implementation of Safe at Safe::World::Compartment,
        with simpler code and less sub call and variables criations for reval().
      - use of select_static on initialization to avoid new selections.
      - Fixed some minor bug in the headers handler for HEADOUT.
